# UseFormik
In this exercise, I create a simple react project UseFormik.
And then, in the root folder, I create sub folders public, src,
together with a package.json file.
In the command line, I cd to the project path, 
run npm install to install the dependencies for this project,
and run run npm start.

In src/App.js I use formik to create a form, validate its fields, 
and submit it at last.
